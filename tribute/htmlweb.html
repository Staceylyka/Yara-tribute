        <p>After graduating from highschool, she joined Havard university where she majored in Afican American studies.
            I have mostly known her from her role as Zoey Johnson in the sitcom Blackish.Her character inspires me as a young female black 
            woman who is continuing to fulfill her dreams in her career.She began her career when she was only six years old until now she is producing her 
            own shows.
            Apart from her success in education and career in acting role,Yara also has an exquisite taste in fashion.
